== Description ==

The F2 Tumblr Widget displays recent posts from the provided tumblr blog.

It allows the user to select how many posts to display, to restrict which 
posts are shown by type and tag, and to render the posts as either a list 
or a slideshow.

Posts can be displayed in full, as title only, or with an excerpt. Photo,
video and audio posts will have the media displayed when the display type
is not 'title only'.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `f2-tumblr` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install directly through the 'Add New' option in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is the title for a post determined? =

Tumblr does not allow all post types to have a formal title defined. For
those post types (such as photos), either the first HTML header in the caption
will be used (h1 to h3) or, if none can be found, the first sentence.
